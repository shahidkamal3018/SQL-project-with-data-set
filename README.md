**How to Practice**
Set Up Tables: Create the tables and insert the sample data in a SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
Experiment with Variations: Modify queries and explore different scenarios.
Test on Large Data: Use synthetic data generators or tools like Mockaroo for large datasets.
Combine Concepts: Try creating complex queries combining joins, subqueries, and window functions.
